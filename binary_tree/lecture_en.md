#ALGORITHM ANLYSIS
  In fact an algorithm is clearly specified set of simple instructions to be followed to solve the
problem.Once an algorithm is given for a problem and decided to be correct,an important step is to
determine how much of the resources, such as time or space, the algorithm will require. An algorithm that
solves a problem but requires a year is hardly of any use. Likewise, an algorithm that requires a gigabyte
of main memmory is not useful.
  In this blog, we shall talk about how to estimate the time and extra space for the an algorithm.
